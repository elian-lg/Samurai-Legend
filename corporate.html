        <h2>About Samurai Legend</h2>
        <p>Samurai Legend was founded in 700 CE/BC with a mission to preserve and promote the artistry and craftsmanship of the legendary samurai sword. Our founder, Amakuni Yasutsuna, was the legendary swordsmith who is credited to have created the first single-edged longsword.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to bring the spirit of the samurai to the modern world. We believe that the katana is more than just a weapon; it's a symbol of honor, discipline, and artistry. We strive to create katanas that are not only functional but also embody the spirit of the samurai.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We envision a world where the values of the samurai - honor, discipline, and artistry - are recognized and appreciated. Through our katanas, we aim to inspire our customers to embrace these values in their own lives.</p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>We value craftsmanship, tradition, and authenticity. Each of our katanas is meticulously crafted by skilled artisans using traditional techniques. We believe in staying true to the spirit of the samurai and honoring the legacy of the katana.</p>
